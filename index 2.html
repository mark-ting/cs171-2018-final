            <h1>The Birth of Blue Bikes</h1>

            <text class="bodytext"><p> Together, the three cities of Boston, Cambridge, and Somerville, along with the
                Town of Brookline, created the Blue Bike system. Blue Bikes are made possible through their funding and
                operated by Motivate, a company that operates bicycle sharing systems. Motivate, now owned by Lyft, uses
                technology provided by 8D Technologies and PBSC Urban Solutions for bikes, parts, and docking stations.
                Without all these municipal and corporate entities, along with the demand from environmentally and
                health conscious constituents, we would not be as successful as we are today. </p>

                <p>Blue Bikes offers single rides for $2.50 (up to 45 minutes in duration) as well as annual, monthly,
                    72-hour, and 24-hour memberships. All membership options allow you to take a Blue Bikes bicycle for
                    an unlimited number of trips - up to 45 minutes each in duration. After 45 minutes, "overtime" fees
                    of $2.50 per each 30 minute block of time are incurred.</p>

                    </br>

                    <p>Hubway became operational on July 28, 2011, with an event in which members could ride bicycles
                        from City Hall Plaza to a designated bicycle station. On March 15, 2012, Hubway was relaunched
                        for the season with the abutting communities of Brookline, Cambridge, and Somerville also
                        joining. By the end of the 2012 season on November 28, the system had 105 stations and 1,050
                        bikes. While a majority of the stations continued to be shut down for the winter season over the
                        first years of the program, 25 stations in Cambridge remained open during a successful winter
                        pilot program which became permanent. After the full system relaunched on April 2, 2014, it grew
                        to 140 stations and over 1,300 bikes.</p>

                    <p>Full system operations for 2014 concluded on November 26, though the system expanded its winter
                        operations. For the second year, almost all Cambridge-based stations remained open year-round,
                        and those stations were joined by 62 Boston-based stations that remained open through December
                        31, 2014. Inclement weather pushed back the full system reopening until April 17, 2015, and
                        during the 2015 season the system grew to 155 stations and over 1,500 bicycles. In 2015, regular
                        season operations concluded on November 25, though again Hubway expanded its winter operations
                        further, with 110 stations remaining open through December 7, 2015; of those, 107 stayed open
                        through December 31; and of those, the 37 Cambridge-based stations once again remain open
                        year-round.In May 2017, Boston Mayor Marty Walsh announced a planned two-year expansion, adding
                        70 new stations and offering year-round service.</p>

                    <p>On March 7, 2018, Hubway announced a six-year partnership with Blue Cross Blue Shield of
                        Massachusetts, which included a system-wide re-branding as Blue Bikes, along with expanding the
                        system to 3,000 bikes and adding over 100 new stations by the end of 2019. The new sponsorship
                        with Blue Cross covers all four municipalities. The name change took effect on May 9, 2018, with
                        the release of new and re-branded bicycles.</p></text>
